# Vernacular Programming Language - Complete Usage Guide

## Introduction
Vernacular 3.0 is an enterprise-ready natural language programming system that allows you to write programs using plain English commands. It supports both interactive REPL mode and script file execution with a professional command-line interface.

### üÜï **New in Version 3.0: Python-Style Block Structure**
Vernacular now supports **Python-style indented blocks** alongside the original single-line syntax:

```vernacular
# Original single-line syntax (still supported)
if age is greater than 18 then print "Adult"
repeat 3 times: print "Hello"

# New Python-style block syntax
if age is greater than 18:
    print "You are an adult"
    print "You can vote"
    print "You have full rights"
```

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Interactive REPL Mode**
```bash
python3 vernacular.py
```

You'll see:
```
=== Natural Language Programming REPL ===
Type commands in plain English. Type 'quit' to exit, 'help' for commands.

>>> 
```

### **Script Execution Mode**
```bash
python3 vernacular.py script.vern        # Execute a script file
python3 vernacular.py script.vern -v     # Execute with verbose output
python3 vernacular.py --help             # Show help and usage
python3 vernacular.py --version          # Show version information
```

### **Command Line Options**
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message with examples
- `--version`: Display version information  
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose execution output
- `script.vern`: Path to vernacular script file to execute

---

## üìú **Script File Support**

### **Creating .vern Scripts**
Vernacular scripts use the `.vern` extension and support:
- **Comments**: Use `#` or `//` for line comments
- **All Commands**: Every command available in REPL works in scripts
- **Block Structure**: Python-style indented blocks with colons
- **Mixed Syntax**: Combine single-line and block structure in the same script
- **Error Reporting**: Line-by-line error reporting with statistics

### **Example Script Structure**
```vernacular
# My First Vernacular Script
# This demonstrates basic features

# Variables and output
set name to "Alice"
print "Hello"
print name

# Mathematics
add 10 and 5
calculate the square root of 144

# Lists and loops
create list numbers with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
for each item in list numbers do print item

# Conditionals
if name equals "Alice" then print "Name matches!"
```

### **Example Scripts**
The `examples/` directory contains demonstration scripts:
- `examples/hello_world.vern` - Basic features showcase
- `examples/database_demo.vern` - Database operations demo  
- `examples/math_and_files.vern` - Mathematical computations and file I/O

### **Running Example Scripts**
```bash
python3 vernacular.py examples/hello_world.vern
python3 vernacular.py examples/database_demo.vern -v
python3 vernacular.py examples/math_and_files.vern
```

## üêç **Python-Style Block Structure**

### **Block Types Supported**
Vernacular 3.0 supports **7 different block types** with Python-style indentation:

#### **Conditional Blocks**
```vernacular
# Simple conditional block
if age is greater than 18:
    print "You are an adult"
    print "You can vote"
    print "You have full rights"

# Nested conditional blocks
if score is greater than 90:
    print "Excellent performance!"
    
    if score is greater than 95:
        print "Perfect score category"
        print "You deserve special recognition"
    
    print "You qualify for honors"
```

#### **Else Blocks**
```vernacular
if age is greater than 18:
    print "You are an adult"
else:
    print "You are a minor"
    print "You need parental consent"
```

#### **Loop Blocks**
```vernacular
# Repeat blocks
repeat 3 times:
    print "This is iteration number:"
    print "Loop body can contain multiple commands"
    print "Each command is properly indented"

# For each blocks
create list items with apple, banana, cherry
for each item in list items:
    print "Processing item:"
    print item
    print "Item processed successfully"

# While blocks
set counter to 0
while counter is less than 5:
    print "Counter value:"
    print counter
    increment counter
```

#### **Function Definition Blocks**
```vernacular
# Function without parameters
define function greet_user:
    print "Hello there!"
    print "Welcome to Vernacular 3.0"
    print "This is a block-structured function"

# Function with parameters
define function calculate_area with length, width:
    multiply length and width
    print "Area calculation complete"
    print result

# Call the functions
call function greet_user
call function calculate_area
```

### **Indentation Rules**
- **Spaces or Tabs**: Use spaces or tabs consistently (tabs = 4 spaces)
- **Consistent Indentation**: All commands in a block must have the same indentation level
- **Nested Blocks**: Deeper indentation creates nested blocks
- **Block Headers**: Lines ending with `:` start new blocks

### **Mixed Syntax Support**
You can combine both syntaxes in the same script:

```vernacular
# Single-line commands (original style)
set name to "Alice"
set age to 30
add 10 and 5

# Block structure (new style)
if age is greater than 25:
    print "You are in the adult category"
    print name
    print "is over 25 years old"

# Single-line conditional (original style)
if name equals "Alice" then print "Name matches Alice"

# Mixed function definitions
define function old_style as print "Single-line function"
define function new_style:
    print "Block-structured function"
    print "Can have multiple lines"
```

### **Supported Block Patterns**
- `if condition:` - Conditional blocks
- `else:` - Else blocks
- `for each item in list listname:` - For each loops
- `while condition:` - While loops
- `repeat N times:` - Repeat loops
- `define function name:` - Function definitions
- `define function name with params:` - Parameterized functions
